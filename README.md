#  Pointers in C#
##  What are Pointers?
Pointers are variables that instead of holding values, hold the address where the value is stored in the memory (GeeksForGeeks, 2025).

##  Why are Pointers Used?
Pointers are used when using 'Unsafe Code'. Unsafe code is code thats safety cannot be verified. Pointers are used to then allocate and free code and call the 'Unsafe Code' with the pointer (learn.Microsoft, 2025).
